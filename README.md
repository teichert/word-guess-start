# Word-Guess

After you are done with it, this progam will be a simple word-guessing game similar to "hangman".

## Task
1. Get a copy of this starter project and make sure you have the .Net-5 SDK.
2. Read the code in `WordGuess.cs` and ask questions if you don't understand any of it.
3. Run the code (with `dotnet run`).
4. Fix the code so that the assertions pass (in particular look at the `TODO` comments).
5. Submit and pass-off with instructor or TA.
